Problem: 

During a district wide online testing window, one school reports that students devices show as "connected", but testing platforms
fail to load. 

I approached this using the OSI model to avoid guesswork and reduce downtime. 

Layer 1: Verified wireless access points and uplinks were operational.
Layer 2: Confirmed devices were associating successfully. 
Layer 3: Identified devices were placed in an incorrect VLAN with no routing access. 
Layer 7: Ruled out application failure once routing was corrected. 

Troubleshooting Approach (OSI-Based)
Step 1: Verify Physical and Data Link Connectivity (Layers 1–2)
Command
show interface status

Expected Output
Port      Name               Status       Vlan       Duplex  Speed  Type
Gi1/0/24                     connected    20         full    1000   10/100/1000BaseTX

Explanation

The port is physically up (connected)

The device is assigned to VLAN 20

Physical layer issues are ruled out

The port was assigned to VLAN 20, which is not intended to provide access to instructional resources. 
Given the device role and the timing of the issue, the VLAN assignment immediately became suspect.

VLAN 20 is wrong, because VLANs are assigned based on function, not numbering. VLAN 20 did not have the
routing or access policies required for instructional devices. 

Step 2: Verify Interface Configuration (Layer 2)
Command
show running-config interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24

Expected Output
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
 spanning-tree portfast

Explanation

Port is configured correctly as an access port

Device is statically assigned to VLAN 20

VLAN 20 is an administrative VLAN and does not have routing access to instructional resources

Root cause identified: incorrect VLAN assignment

Corrective Action: VLAN Assignment Fix
Configuration Change (No Output Expected)
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 switchport access vlan 10
end


Note: Configuration commands do not return output. Validation is performed using show commands.

Step 3: Validate VLAN Membership (Layer 2)
Command
show vlan brief

Expected Output
VLAN Name              Status    Ports
---- ----------------- --------- ----------------
10   Instructional     active    Gi1/0/24
20   Administrative    active
30   Guest             active

Explanation

Port Gi1/0/24 is now correctly assigned to VLAN 10

Layer 2 segmentation is restored

VLAN correction is confirmed

Step 4: Validate IP Addressing and Gateway Assignment (Layer 3)
Client-Side Validation
Command
ipconfig /all

Expected Output
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.10.45
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.10.1
DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.10.5

Explanation

IP address matches VLAN 10 subnet

Correct default gateway assigned

DHCP is functioning as expected

Device is correctly configured at Layer 3

Step 5: Validate Gateway Reachability (Layer 3)
Command
ping 10.10.10.1

Expected Output
Reply from 10.10.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255
Reply from 10.10.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255

Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)

Explanation

Default gateway is reachable

Device can route traffic off the local VLAN

Inter-VLAN routing is functional

Optional End-to-End Validation
Command
tracert 8.8.8.8

Expected Output
1  <1 ms  <1 ms  <1 ms  10.10.10.1
2   5 ms   4 ms   5 ms  172.16.1.1
3  10 ms   9 ms  10 ms  8.8.8.8

Explanation

Traffic exits VLAN 10 via the gateway

Upstream routing is functioning

End-to-end connectivity confirmed

Resolution Summary

Technical Summary:
The issue was caused by an incorrect VLAN assignment at the access port. After correcting the VLAN and validating Layer 2 and Layer 3 functionality, normal access to instructional resources was restored.

Non-Technical Summary:
Devices were connected to the network but placed in the wrong group. Once they were moved to the correct group, access was restored.

Key Takeaway

This issue was resolved by following a structured OSI-based troubleshooting approach, validating each layer before making targeted changes, and confirming expected behavior after the fix.
